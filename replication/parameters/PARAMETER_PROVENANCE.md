## Source legend

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **SI-quote** | SI has a verbatim quote stating this value. Must be grep-able against `papers/ja9b03646_si_001.pdf`. |
| **SI-derived** | Derived from SI text using a stated formula (e.g., λ from MSD_adj). Both formula and input must trace to SI-quote. |
| **SI-implied** | SI mentions the quantity but without explicit value; we chose within range stated. |
| **PLUMED-default** | PLUMED 2.9 docs default value or formula. Must cite doc URL. |
| **GROMACS-inherent** | GROMACS unit convention or default. |
| **Our-choice** | No SI/software mandate; we chose based on reasoning that must be stated. |
| **Legacy-bug** | Historical wrong value; kept here for traceability, not for use. |

## Path CV parameters (`plumed.dat` PATHMSD line)

### `LAMBDA = 379.77 nm⁻²`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | SI-derived (formula) + Our-choice (MSD convention) |
| SI formula | "The λ parameter was computed as 2.3 multiplied by the inverse of the mean square displacement between successive frames, 80." (SI p.S3) |
| Our path's MSD_adj (per-atom) | 0.006056 nm² = 0.6056 Å² |
| Our λ = 2.3 / MSD_adj | 379.77 nm⁻² |
| Secondary verification | FP-022 self-consistency test (2026-04-08): frame_1 → s=1.09, frame_8 → s=8.00, frame_15 → s=14.91 |
| Cross-check via 5DVZ projection | s(5DVZ) = 1.07 (O-like, correct) |
| Cross-check via 4HPX (2026-04-16) | s(4HPX) = 14.91 (A-A state is C-like, correct per SI) |
| PLUMED driver self-test | "Consistency check completed! Your path cvs look good!" ✓ |
| **Known alternate interpretation of SI "80"** | summary.txt line 23-25 reads "80" as total SD Å² (not λ). Our total SD = 67.826 Å², ratio 0.85× vs 80 Å² — matches SI within 15%. If "80" is total SD, our λ follows from 2.3/per-atom-MSD = 379.77 (consistent). If "80" is λ directly (nm⁻²), our λ would be 4.75× too sharp — **but CV audit shows path is physically correct either way, so the ambiguity is moot for action.** See FP-027 for why this ambiguity misled diagnosis. |
| Status | ✅ verified self-consistent for our path; cross-species structural projection (4HPX) confirms CV ordering |

### `REFERENCE = path_gromacs.pdb`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | SI-quote (path endpoints + residue selection) |
| O endpoint | 1WDW chain B (PfTrpS, P. furiosus) — SI Figure S1 caption |
| C endpoint | 3CEP chain B (StTrpS, S. typhimurium) — SI Figure S1 caption |
| Atom selection | 112 Cα from residues 97-184 (COMM) + 282-305 (base region) — SI p.S3 |
| Interpolation | 15 frames linear Cartesian between O and C endpoints — SI p.S3 |
| Pre-alignment | Kabsch on the 112 Cα themselves — Our-choice (SI doesn't specify) |
| Total RMSD(O,C) in our frame | 10.895 Å per-atom mean (summary.txt) |
| Secondary verification | Direct resid matching validated (both 1WDW and 3CEP chain B have 112/112 CV residues); MDAnalysis script `generate_path_cv.py` |
| Generation commit | 43a810c, first shipped 2026-04-06; path_gromacs.pdb runtime file committed 669e303 on 2026-04-09 |
| Status | ✅ endpoints byte-match SI description; interpolation method self-consistent; CV audit (2026-04-16) confirms physical correctness |

## MetaD parameters (`plumed.dat` METAD line)

### `ARG = path.sss, path.zzz`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | PLUMED-default (PATHMSD component names) |
| PLUMED 2.9 docs | "sss" = position on path, "zzz" = distance from path |
| Status | ✅ |

### `SIGMA = 0.1`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | Our-choice (SI silent on numerical value) |
| SI quote | "The adaptive Gaussian width scheme... was used" (SI p.S3) — references Branduardi 2012, no numerical SIGMA |
| Semantic (PLUMED 2.9 METAD docs) | "Sigma is one number that has distance units" — single Cartesian scalar in nm for ADAPTIVE=GEOM |
| Why 0.1 nm | Doubled from earlier 0.05 (FP-024 fix 2026-04-15); chosen as reasonable geometric seed for adaptive Gaussian kernel |
| Status | ✅ FP-024 remediated; pending probe-extension verification |

### `ADAPTIVE = GEOM`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | SI-quote (adaptive width used) + PLUMED-default (GEOM is one of two variants) |
| Alternatives | DIFF (dot-product of CV gradients) |
| Why GEOM | Standard for PATHMSD; Branduardi 2012 default |
| Status | ✅ |

### `SIGMA_MIN = 0.3, 0.005`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | Our-choice (SI silent) + PLUMED-default (no default, must set for ADAPTIVE) |
| PLUMED 2.9 METAD docs | "the lower bounds for the sigmas (in CV units) when using adaptive hills" |
| s-axis floor 0.3 | Our choice: path axis spans [1,15] = 14 s-units, floor = ~2% of axis |
| z-axis floor 0.005 nm² | Our choice: observed z in Job 42679152 was 0.002-0.13 nm² (FP-024); floor just below typical |
| Why this exists | Prevents ADAPTIVE=GEOM sigma from collapsing (FP-024 observed collapse to 0.011 s-units, 1% of axis) |
| Status | ✅ FP-024 remediated |

### `SIGMA_MAX = 1.0, 0.05`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | Our-choice (SI silent) |
| s-axis ceiling 1.0 | ~7% of axis; prevents Gaussian spreading to wash out structure |
| z-axis ceiling 0.05 nm² | Above typical z range but below unphysical |
| Status | ✅ |

### `HEIGHT = 0.628` (kJ/mol)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | SI-quote (direct) + unit conversion |
| SI quote | "Initial Gaussian potentials of height 0.15 kcal·mol⁻¹" (SI p.S3) |
| Conversion | 0.15 × 4.184 = 0.6276 ≈ 0.628 kJ/mol |
| Status | ✅ |

### `PACE = 1000` (steps)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | SI-derived from deposition interval |
| SI quote | "deposited every 2 ps of MD simulation at 350 K" (SI p.S3) |
| Derivation | 2 ps / 2 fs timestep = 1000 steps |
| Status | ✅ |

### `BIASFACTOR = 10`

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | SI-quote (direct) |
| SI quote | "well-tempered adaptative bias with a bias factor of 10" (SI p.S3) |
| Status | ✅ |

### `TEMP = 350` (K)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | SI-quote (direct) |
| SI quote | "2 ps of MD simulation at 350 K" (SI p.S3) |
| Physical rationale | P. furiosus is thermophile; PfTrpB experiments at 75 °C |
| Status | ✅ |

### `dt = 0.002` (ps = 2 fs)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | SI-quote (direct) |
| SI quote | "a 2 fs timestep" (SI p.S3) |
| Status | ✅ |

### `nsteps = 5,000,000` (probe, to be extended to 25,000,000 via convert-tpr -extend)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Source | Our-choice (probe duration) |
| Rationale | 10 ns probe: verify SIGMA floor fix before committing to 50+ ns production |
| Now | Extended to 25,000,000 (50 ns total) via `gmx convert-tpr -extend 40000` 2026-04-16 |
| Status | ✅ |

## How to use this document

1. **Before modifying any parameter**, read the relevant row. Cite it in your commit message.
2. **Before trusting an SI "quote" someone cites**, grep for it in `papers/ja9b03646_si_001.pdf` via `pdfgrep` or `pdftotext | grep`.
3. **Before overriding the current value**, read the "Known alternate interpretation" if any. Don't re-interpret if the ambiguity is moot (e.g., LAMBDA's SI-80 ambiguity is moot because CV audit passes).
4. **When adding a new parameter**, copy a row's structure: source, verification, status.
5. **If a parameter fails verification**, add a new FP entry in `failure-patterns.md`, update this table, and move the old value to the "legacy" section.

## Secondary verification actions taken for this doc (2026-04-16)

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Read SI p.S3 verbatim for SIGMA | Confirmed SI has no numerical SIGMA; only "adaptive Gaussian width scheme" |
| Read summary.txt lines 23-25 for λ interpretation | "Reported MSD: ~80 Å² (interpreted as total SD) / Our total SD: 67.826 Å² (ratio 0.85x)" — treat "80" as total SD, NOT as λ |
| Fetch PLUMED 2.9 PATHMSD docs via jina-reader | Confirmed "sss"/"zzz" component naming, OPTIMAL default alignment, LAMBDA in plumed units (nm⁻² for GROMACS) |
| Fetch PLUMED 2.9 RESTART docs | Confirmed RESTART directive needed for HILLS append; "not all MD codes send PLUMED restart info, if unsure always put RESTART" |
| CV audit via offline projection (`.worktrees/cv-audit/project_structures.py`) | 1WDW→s=1.09, 3CEP→s=14.91, 4HPX→s=14.91, 5DW0→s=1.07, z range [-0.00025, 0.02451] nm² — path CV physically correct |
| Codex adversarial review | Caught the SI-"80"-as-λ misinterpretation (FP-027); confirmed FP-022 validation is narrow but fine for its scope |
